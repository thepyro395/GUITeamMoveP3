# GUITeamMoveP3
This project was where we took the teams list that was given with 20 teams and made a GUI to sort them.
After getting the teams to sort our Professor told us to hard code letters for each number (1a,2bb, etc etce).
After that we had to make it where it we can select an element buy clicking the bullet point next to it or the element itself and move based on the second click.
